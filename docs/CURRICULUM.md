# Curriculum data

Harrington's map, daily choices, calendar and tests all come from the
[Marble Skill Taxonomy](https://github.com/withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy): about
1,845 small topics in 9 subjects, each with an age range, evidence of mastery
and a suggested question, joined by about 3,941 prerequisite links ("this
topic builds on that one"). Harrington reads four of its files:

| File | What Harrington uses it for |
| --- | --- |
| `topics.json` | Every topic: id, subject, domain, name, description, ages, evidence, `assessmentPrompt`, and any field Harrington does not use yet (such as `standards`), served as is |
| `dependencies.json` | Prerequisite links, `hard` (required) or `soft` (helpful), each with a reason |
| `clusters.json` | Parent-facing summaries of a domain at one age |
| `manifest.json` | Counts, `taxonomyVersion`, `generatedAt` and the upstream's own file hashes |

The upstream publishes more files (for example `curriculum-standards.json` and
`teaching-research.json`). Harrington does not download them yet.

## Licence

The data is not Harrington's. The database (structure, ids, links) is under
**ODbL 1.0** and the text (names, descriptions, evidence, reasons, summaries)
under **CC BY-SA 4.0**; curriculum-standard codes keep their own licences.
Harrington uses the data as a produced work and keeps the attribution in the
app, [`NOTICE`](../NOTICE) and the README. See
[`DATA-LICENSE.md`](../DATA-LICENSE.md). Never commit a copy of the files.

## How Harrington gets the files

The revision is pinned in one place, [`lib/taxonomy-pin.mjs`](../lib/taxonomy-pin.mjs):

```js
export const TAXONOMY_PIN = {
  revision: '<40-character commit>',
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  upstream: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy/<commit>/data',
  files: { 'topics.json': '<sha256>', 'dependencies.json': '<sha256>', ... },
};
```

`server.mjs`, the e2e suite (`tests/e2e/support/taxonomy.mjs`) and
`npm run taxonomy:check` all import it.

- On the first request for a file, the server downloads it from the pinned
  upstream, checks its SHA-256 against `files`, and caches it in
  `HARRINGTON_DATA_DIR/taxonomy/`. A file that does not match is refused (the
  browser shows "Curriculum file … failed its integrity check, so it was not
  saved", with both hashes) and is not cached. This download is Harrington's
  one outbound call that needs no opt-in.
- After that the cache is served as is, with no further network calls. The
  curriculum does not update on its own.
- `/api/health` (signed in) reports `taxonomy`:

  | Value | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | `verified` | Every cached file matches the pin |
  | `outdated` | A cached file comes from another revision, usually an install older than the pin. It is still served, and the server logs one warning naming the command below |
  | `integrity-failed` | A download did not match the pin and was refused |
  | `unchecked` | `HARRINGTON_TAXONOMY_UPSTREAM` points at a custom upstream |
  | `not-downloaded` | Nothing cached yet |

  and `taxonomyRevision` (the pinned commit, or `null` for a custom upstream).

### A custom upstream (experiments only)

`HARRINGTON_TAXONOMY_UPSTREAM=<url ending in /data>` makes the server download
from somewhere else, for example a local fork. **Files from a custom upstream
are not checked**: the server logs a warning at startup and health says
`unchecked`. Setting it to the pinned URL itself is not custom. Unset it to go
back to the pin.

### Moving an existing install to the pinned revision

An install that cached an earlier revision keeps serving it (health:
`outdated`). To move it:

```bash
# With Harrington stopped:
npm run taxonomy:check -- --install   # downloads, verifies, replaces the cache all or nothing
npm start
```

Deleting `data/private/taxonomy/` and restarting does the same on first use.
Read "Retired topics" below first: a revision can retire topics the family has
worked on.

## Bumping the pin

1. **Pick the commit.** Take a commit of `withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy` (never a
   branch). Read its `data/manifest.json` at that commit: `counts`
   (topics, `topicsBySubject`, dependencies, clusters) and
   `files.<name>.sha256`.
2. **Get the hashes and check them yourself.**

   ```bash
   R=<commit>
   for f in topics.json dependencies.json clusters.json manifest.json; do
     curl -sSfo "/tmp/$f" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/withmarbleapp/os-taxonomy/$R/data/$f"
   done
   sha256sum /tmp/*.json
   ```

   The first three must equal the manifest's `sha256`. `manifest.json` does
   not list itself; take its hash from `sha256sum`.
3. **Edit `lib/taxonomy-pin.mjs`:** `revision`, `date`, `upstream` and the four
   hashes. Nothing else holds the revision.
4. **Verify:** `npm run taxonomy:check` (CI's isolation job runs it too).
5. **Diff the two revisions** before touching fixtures: new and removed
   subjects, removed topic ids, topics whose subject, domain, `ageRangeStart`
   or `name` changed. A short Node script over the old and new `topics.json`
   does it.
6. **New subjects:** add each to `SUBJECTS` in `src/js/data.js` (a colour with
   at least 4.5:1 contrast on the paper background and a Lucide icon from the
   vendored set), to `REALM_PLACES` in `src/js/graph.js` (a free spot on the
   world map) and to `DEFAULT_MODE` in `src/js/views/masterytest.js`. Until you
   do, the app still shows the subject in neutral grey and logs one warning.
7. **Fixtures.** `git grep -n -E "<old topic count>|<old link count>"` finds the
   counts the specs and docs hard-code (api, dashboard, map, topic,
   walkthrough). Per-subject counts (`/576 mastered`), section sizes
   (`COUNTING_SECTION_OTHERS` in `tests/e2e/support/family.mjs`) and the
   one-domain realm in `map.spec.mjs` follow the diff. Prefer topic ids to
   names in specs: names change between revisions.
8. **Run** `npm test`, then `npm run e2e:ui-docs`, which downloads the new pin
   into `tests/e2e/.cache/taxonomy-<commit>/` and regenerates the screenshots
   in `docs/e2e/screenshots`. The CI cache key follows the pin file.
9. **Write it up:** a CHANGELOG entry with the before and after counts, the
   retired ids and any behaviour a parent will notice (daily choices shift
   when topics change age), and the counts in README, the Guide
   (`src/docs/GUIDE.md`, `src/js/views/guide.js`) and this file.

## Retired topics

A revision can drop a topic id. The 2026-10-24 revision retired one:
`mt_3XJkeIn6J6` (Mathematics / Measurement, "Estimating answers (age 7+)"),
with no recorded replacement.

A family document may still hold mastery, practice, recall, lesson-cache,
calendar, daily-offer, workbook or request entries for such an id. Harrington's
rule:

- **Keep the data.** Nothing is deleted, and load, import and save never refuse
  a document for it. An export still carries it.
- **Leave it out of counts and choices.** Topic counts, progress rings,
  recommendations, daily choices, the calendar track, recall and practice due
  counts and the bell skip it. Its recall cards and practice questions keep
  their schedule but are never due.
- **Show it.** Records lists it under **Archived topics**, with the name the
  family's data stored for it (from a record or calendar entry), else its id,
  and what is kept. Its old topic page says "This topic is no longer in the
  curriculum" and links to Records. An id no learner's data mentions is still
  "Topic not found".

If a later revision brings the id back, everything reappears as it was.

## Age shifts

A revision can move a topic's starting age (113 topics moved in 2026-10-24).
Harrington derives ages from the taxonomy each time it reads them; nothing in
the family's data stores a topic's age except history:

- The calendar track, daily choices, sections and placement are worked out
  from the current ages, so today's choices may differ after a refresh.
- A level-set workbook sheet reads its age band from its topics' current ages;
  the band stored on the sheet is only a fallback.
- Test results keep the section id they were taken in (`Subject|Domain|age`)
  and a placement record keeps its title ("up to age 8"): they record what
  happened then.
