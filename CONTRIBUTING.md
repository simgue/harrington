# Contributing to Harrington

Thanks for your interest in improving Harrington! Contributions of all kinds are
welcome — bug fixes, features, docs, and design.

## Ground rules

- By contributing, you agree your contributions are licensed under the
  **MIT License** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)).
- **Do not commit a copy of the curriculum dataset.** Harrington loads the
  Marble Skill Taxonomy at runtime from its open repository. Bundling or forking
  the data has separate licensing obligations (see [`DATA-LICENSE.md`](DATA-LICENSE.md)).
- Keep the curriculum attribution intact — in the app UI, `NOTICE`, and README.

## Project setup

The browser app is plain HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (ES modules), served
by Harrington's dependency-free Node server. A small asset build compiles the
local Tailwind stylesheet and copies Lucide into `src/vendor/`; it does not
bundle the application code.
Family state, lesson caches, and recordings are stored on that server. AI and
shared-family features are disabled until self-hosted adapters are added.

Run it with Node:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. No external account is required.

## Style

- Match the existing patterns: small focused modules, the `el()` helper for DOM,
  Tailwind utility classes, and Lucide icons (never emoji).
- Keep the app dependency-free (no bundler, no framework).
- Use American English in user-facing text.
- Test your change with at least one synthetic student before opening a PR.

## Pull requests

1. Fork and create a branch: `git checkout -b my-change`.
2. Make focused commits with clear messages.
3. Describe what you changed and how you tested it in the PR.

## Reporting issues

File work in the Linear Harrington team (`HAR`). Include steps to reproduce,
what you expected, what happened, and your browser. Please don't include any
personal or child data in reports.
